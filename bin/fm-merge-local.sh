# This is firstmate's merge gate-action (the captain's merge authority applied
# locally instead of via a GitHub PR). It is the one sanctioned exception to hard
# rule #1 "never run state-changing git in projects/", and it is narrow: it only
# runs for mode=local-only tasks, only after the captain approves (or yolo=on
# auto-approves), and only as a clean fast-forward - it refuses a diverged branch
# and tells you to have the crewmate rebase. See AGENTS.md prime directives,
# project management, and task lifecycle.
